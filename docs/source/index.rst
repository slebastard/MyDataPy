Welcome to My DataPy!
======================

This is a repository where I store all ML/DS functions that I use regularly and that can be made generic.
Everything is in Python, built according to a instance-class logic.
The content of this repository is completely open access. New content is added regularly.

Please see the philosophy section to learn about the way instances (unsupervised or supervised machine-learning methods) are designed in this repo.
For any comment or question, please email lebastardsimon@gmail.com
